Hacked together as an experiment in generating discoverable gesture commands by anaylysing attributes of the gesture.

FFT (using the Accelerate framework) allow us to consider the frequency domain representation of a touch gesture. This allows us to extract metadata about how cyclical, complex, or directional the gesture happens to be.

Coded as a quick experiment on too much caffiene and not enough sleep. Use at your own risk. The current design lacks proper separation of concerns in its arhitecture and is desperately short on tests.

Enjoy.
